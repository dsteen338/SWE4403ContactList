# SWE4403ContactList


Java project for my Software Architecture and Design patterns project as part of my Software Engineering Degree. The application is a simple contact book using Java Swing (created in netbeans). The purpose of the project was to demonstrate an understanding of design patterns, done by including 12 patterns in the relatively small application.
